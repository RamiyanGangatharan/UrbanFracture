# URBAN FRACTURE

Urban Fracture is a first-person shooter (FPS) developed for educational purposes. The game is designed to evoke the look and feel of mid-2000s FPS titles, drawing inspiration from iconic games like Call of Duty, Garry's Mod, and Escape from Tarkov. It's a project intended to help the developer gain experience in game design, mechanics, and systems, offering a mix of action, exploration, and tactical gameplay within a dystopian, broken city environment.

This project is created purely for educational purposes to practice and refine game development skills. The goal is not to produce a fully polished or commercial game, but rather to experiment with game mechanics and systems while capturing the aesthetic and vibe of classic FPS games.
